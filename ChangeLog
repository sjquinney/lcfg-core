	  as helpful as possible

2015-11-03 10:51  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Return NULL rather than exit when a bad template is found

2015-11-02 15:52  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	  functions

2015-11-02 15:44  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Needed to include stdarg.h

2015-11-02 14:03  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Added new lcfgresource_build_message which will format messages

	  derivation). This is mostly handy for generating error messages

2015-11-02 10:48  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* The lcfgresource_get_type_as_string function now just returns the
	  short 'list' name for list types, it does not append the
	  template. The lcfgresource_to_status function now adds the
	  template string where necessary. This makes the _get_as_string
	  function more widely useful

2015-11-02 10:06  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Tweaked the lcfgcomponent_print function to match the changes to
	  the prefix handling in the lcfgresource_to_string and

2015-11-02 09:58  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Altered the way the to_string and to_status functions handle the
	  optional prefix parameter. To make them more convenient, when
	  specified the functions will now add the '.' separator. Added
	  support in the to_string function for a new NOVALUE option which
	  prevents the inclusion of the '=' and any value string in the
	  generated output

2015-10-30 15:21  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lcfg-profilelib release: 1.9.0

2015-10-30 15:19  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	  length. Also improved the error messages when attribute failures
	  occur

2015-10-30 15:00  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Ensure that the resource attribute gathering only uses valid
	  values for each parameter

2015-10-30 15:00  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Ensure that the ultimate error handling for each function does
	  not trample on any error message which has already been set

2015-10-30 14:59  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Reworked the way that templates are handled. When a template is
	  parsed the placeholders will now be found and cached to avoid
	  having to do it multiple times

2015-10-30 13:16  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Reworked lcfgresource_build_name function so that it does not
	  alter the resource name. It now returns a string which can then
	  be passed the lcfgresource_set_name function. This makes the
	  function reusable for other situations

2015-10-30 12:13  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* tidied the output from type_as_string when there is not a list of
	  templates

	* Improved error handling in process_components

2015-10-29 12:38  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Attempt to canonicalize a boolean value when it's not valid

2015-10-27 17:05  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

2015-10-27 16:58  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	  lcfgresource_set functions now return a boolean to indicate
	  success. There are also now enforced validity checks for name and
	  value strings.

2015-10-27 13:53  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Started documenting API for lcfgresource

2015-10-27 13:50  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	  functions to provide a more consistent API

2015-10-26 15:50  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* lcfg-profilelib release: 1.6.0

2015-10-26 14:38  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

2015-10-24 10:01  squinney@INF.ED.AC.UK

	* Converted the resource type field over to using a enum and added
	  _set_as_string and get_as_string functions to convert the values
	  from/to strings. Resources now always have a type (the default
	  being a string) so the has_type method is gone but there is
	  instead a complete set of _is_X functions to check the type. This
	  is used to avoid the need to build the full type string when
	  parsing XML profiles, it is held off until the serialisation
	  stage, this saves both memory and processing time.
