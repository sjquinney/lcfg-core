Packages
=======

Document lcfgpkglist_match

Check all C functions are wrapped in Perl

Expose common constants in Perl - macros/functions for checking value?

Check all Perl functions are documented

Add a few more Perl tests

Utils
=======

Import Perl modules from LCFG-Utils-Perl into LCFG-Core-Perl and
ensure they compile against lcfg-core. Needs to be possible to safely
replace perl-LCFG-Utils with perl-LCFG-Core package.
